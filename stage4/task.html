<p>[TITLE]Practice 3155618[/TITLE]</p><h5>Description</h5><p>For now, we are mining blocks to create a blockchain, but just the blockchain itself is not particularly useful. The most useful information in the blockchain is the data that every block stores. The information can be anything. Let's create a simple chat based on the blockchain. If this blockchain works on the internet, it would be a worldwide chat. Everyone can add a line to this blockchain, but no one can edit it afterward. Every message would be visible to anyone.</p><h5>Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, you need to upgrade the blockchain. Each block, except the Genesis Block, should contain a s<strong>ingle chat message</strong> received by the blockchain before starting the new block mining process. When the new block gets created, the message should become a part of the new block, and all the miners should start to search for a magic number for this block. Remember about using thread synchronization, as there is a lot of shared data.</p><p>You don't need any network connections, as this is only a <strong>simulation of the blockchain</strong>. Use a single blockchain and suppose that any user can send a single message to the blockchain just by invoking one method of the blockchain; this message should be further included within the newly mined blocks and printed as a new line <code>"Block data:"</code>.</p>[ALERT-primary]<p>Note that the single chat message should include whitespaces. To read a string with whitespaces from the input, you'll need to implement a <code>scanner</code> using the functions from the <code>bufio</code> package.</p>[/ALERT]<p>So, the algorithm for adding a single chat message to the blockchain is the following:</p><ol><li><p>The Genesis Block's <code>"Block data:"</code> line should contain the string <code>"No messages"</code>. The Genesis Block should NOT contain any data or message. After the Genesis Block is created and printed, your program should prompt the user: <code>"Enter a single chat message to send to the Blockchain:"</code>.</p></li><li><p>While miners search for a magic number to create the new block, the blockchain should temporarily keep the previously sent chat message in memory.</p></li><li><p>After creating the new block, the previously sent chat message should be included in the new block, printed after the <code>"Block data:"</code> line, and then deleted from memory.</p></li><li><p>The process will repeat from step 1 until the fifth and final block is output.</p></li></ol><h5>Example</h5><p>To be tested successfully, the program must output the information of five (5) blocks in sequence.</p><p>The lines that start with <code>&gt;</code> represent user input. </p><p>Pay close attention to the example output; an empty new line <code>\n</code> must separate each prompt to enter a message, as well as each Block:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Genesis Block:
