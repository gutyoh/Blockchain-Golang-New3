[TITLE]Practice 3155613[/TITLE] <h5>Description</h5><p>Blockchain has a simple interpretation: it's just a chain of
    blocks. It represents a sequence of data that you can't break in the middle; you can only append new data at the end
    of it. All the blocks in the blockchain are chained together.</p><p>Check out <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this great
    video about the blockchain</a>. It uses a different approach to reach the final result of the project, which is
    cryptocurrencies, but it explains the blockchain pretty well.<br><br>To be called a blockchain, every block must
    include the <strong>hash of the previous block</strong>. Other fields of the block are optional and can store
    various information. The hash of the block is <strong>the hash of all fields of a block</strong>. So, you can just
    create a string containing every element of a block and then get the hash of this string.<br><br>Note that if you
    change one block in the middle, the hash of this block will also change. and the next block in the chain would no
    longer contain the hash of the previous block. Therefore, it’s easy to check that the chain is invalid.</p><h5>
    Objectives</h5><p>In the first stage, you need to implement such a blockchain. In addition to storing the <em>hash
    of the previous block</em>, every block must also have a unique and sequential <em>id</em> represented by an <code>int</code> and
    the newly calculated <em>hash of the block</em>.</p><p>The chain starts with the <strong>Genesis Block</strong>
    with <strong>id=1</strong>, which marks the beginning of the blockchain and sets the foundation for all subsequent
    blocks. You should implement an independent function that creates the Genesis Block, and since the Genesis Block
    does not have a preceding block, its hash of the previous block must be <code>0</code>.</p><p>Apart from the id and
    hash of the blocks, the Genesis Block and every subsequent block must contain a <strong>timestamp</strong>
    representing the time the block was created. You can use the <code>time.Now().UnixMilli()</code> function to get the
    timestamp; it returns an <code>int64</code> value with the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">timestamp := time.Now().UnixMilli() // 1675514955056</code></pre><p>Your solution should
    have at least two functions: the first one generates a new block in the blockchain, and the second one validates the
    blockchain and returns true if the blockchain is valid. Of course, the Blockchain should store all its generated
    blocks. The validation function should validate all the blocks of this blockchain.</p><p>Also, for hashing blocks,
    you need to choose a good cryptographic hash function that is impossible to reverse-engineer. Insecure hash
    functions allow hackers to change the information of the block so that the hash of the block stays the same, so the
    hash function must be secure. A good example of a secure hash function is SHA-256.</p><p>Finally, to calculate the
    hash of the block, you can create a string containing the block's <em>id</em>, <em>timestamp,</em> and the <em>hash
        of the previous block</em> and then use functions from the <code>crypto/sha256</code> package to calculate the
    hash. Below is an example of the <code>CalculateHash()</code> function that returns a <code>string</code> with the
    hexadecimal representation of the newly calculated hash:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func CalculateHash(blockID int, timestamp int64, previousBlockHash string) string {
    blockData := fmt.Sprintf("%d%d%s", blockID, timestamp, previousBlockHash)

    sha256Hash := sha256.New()
    sha256Hash.Write([]byte(blockData))

    return fmt.Sprintf("%x", sha256Hash.Sum(nil))
}</code></pre><p>Your program must only create and output five (5) blocks in this stage.</p><h5>Example</h5><p>The
    example below shows how your output might look. To be tested successfully, the program must output the information
    of five (5) blocks in sequence.</p><p>Pay close attention to the example output; an empty new line <code>\n</code>
    must separate each Block: </p>
